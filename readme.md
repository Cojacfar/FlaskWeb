# Creating web apps with Flask in Azure
This tutorial describes how to get started running Python with Flask in [Azure App Service Web Apps]. You can sign up for a [free trial] to utilize a $200 credit for running any of the services on Azure. Azure provides unlimited scaling, easy integration with other Microsoft Services, and a multitude of development options including Python!

We are creating an application named *FlaskWeb* using Flask, a popular lightweight framework for Python web development. Other popular choices include Django and Bottle. We suggest reading our comprehensive guide on [Managing Python on Azure App Service], but this tutorial covers the required portions to get your Flask application running. This application is deployed from your local Git repository.

## Prerequisites
* Windows, Mac, or Linux
* Git
* Text/Code Editor (Notebook, atom.io, [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), etc.)

For Git on Windows, we recommend [Git for Windows] or [GitHub for Windows].  If you use Visual Studio, you can also use the integrated Git support. You need to create a local Git repository that is later used to deploy your Web App. For this example, we're naming the repository **FlaskWeb**.

## Create a Web App in the Azure Portal
The first step in creating your app is to create the web app via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Application creation can also be done with Azure CLI, but we are not covering that here.

1. Log in to the Azure Portal and click the **NEW** button in the bottom left corner.
2. Click **Web + Mobile**.
3. Click **Web App**.
4. Configure the Web App, such as creating a new App Service plan and a new resource group for it. Then, click **Create**.
5. Configure Git publishing for your newly created web app by following the instructions at [Local Git Deployment to Azure App Service](app-service-deploy-local-git.md).

## Python Configuration
Now that your web application is launched, we can begin customizing it for Flask. Our first task is to install the Python version of your choice. You can view the details of this in the [managing Python documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/managing-python-on-azure-app-service#choosing-a-python-version-through-the-azure-portal).

1. On the overview page, scroll down to **Development Tools**.
2. Select **Extensions > Add**.
3. Scroll through the list to find the version of Python you want. For this tutorial, we are going with **Python 3.6.1 x64**.

## Environment
### Web Application Configuration Files
Our Flask Deployment uses Fast CGI to interface with the web application server. In order to configure Azure for Fast CGI, we need to add two files. First, we create a file that is required for every deployment type, `web.config`. This file tells the Web Application Server how we want it to actually run our program.

 **web.config** file:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
    <appSettings>
      <add key="PYTHONPATH" value="D:\home\site\wwwroot"/>
      <add key="WSGI_HANDLER" value="FlaskWeb.app"/>
      <add key="WSGI_LOG" value="D:\home\LogFiles\wfastcgi.log"/>
  </appSettings>
  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <add name="PythonHandler" path="*" verb="*" modules="FastCgiModule" scriptProcessor="D:\home\Python361x64\python.exe|D:\home\Python361x64\wfastcgi.py" resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="Script"/>
    </handlers>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

You may have noticed that we declare `appSettings`, provide a `PythonPath`, and a location for the WSGI handler. Additionally, we provide a path to the `scriptProcessor` which depends on the version of Python you installed. If you are using Python361x64, you don't need to change anything here.

Next, we create a FastCGI interface file. We've already referenced this file's location in the config. We create this file and name it **FlaskWeb.py**. Copy the following code into FlaskWeb.py within your local Github repository for this project:

```python
from FlaskWeb import app

if __name__ = '__main__:
    app.run()
```

> [!NOTE]
> Indentation is important in Python!

In order to easily configure the environment on the Web Application service to contain our dependencies, we  use a `requirements.txt` file. PIP, which is installed with the Python extension, is used to take care of the packages our application needs. The following code should be copied into a requirements.txt file in your repository:
```XML
    click==6.7
    Flask==0.12.2
    itsdangerous==0.24
    Jinja2==2.9.6
    MarkupSafe==1.0
    Werkzeug==0.12.2
```

Additionally, we are utilizing PIP ourselves afterwards through Kudu. For this reason, we include another optional file: *.skipPythonDeployment*, note the *.* at the beginning. Create this file on the top level, and leave it empty. This tells the Azure Web App to skip the normal Python deployment steps.

With these files, we are able to quickly configure the Azure Web App instance once we have pushed our Git Repository to Azure by running a `pip install requirements.txt`.

## Flask Development
Now we're ready to create our Flask application! For the purposes of our example, we're going to make a very simple Flask application.

Flask can be set up in many different ways, and here we are making a very minimal application that can be built upon easily. This application doesn't utilize a database or any other external functionality, but all of that can be easily added later!

In the root of your Git repository (along with your configuration files), create a *FlaskWeb* folder. Underneath this folder, you should create *static* and *templates* folders to look like this:
```XML
    /FlaskWeb
    	/Static
    	/Templates
    web.config
    requirements.txt
    FlaskWeb.py
```

In the **FlaskWeb** folder, we're going to create two files - one to initialize our app and one to define how to handle specific URLs - called *routing*. Create **\_\_init__.py ** (two underscores on each side) and **views.py**.

*\_\_init__.py*
```python
"""
The flask application package. This is where we initialize Flask
"""
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
wsgi_app = app.wsgi_app #Registering with IIS
import FlaskWeb.views
```
*views.py*
```python
"""
Routes and views for the flask application.
"""

from datetime import datetime
from flask import render_template
from FlaskWeb import app

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
def home():
    """Renders the home page."""
    return render_template(
        'index.html',
        title='Home Page',
        year=datetime.now().year,
    )

@app.route('/contact')
def contact():
    """Renders the contact page."""
    return render_template(
        'contact.html',
        title='Contact',
        year=datetime.now().year,
        message='Your contact page.'
    )

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    """Renders the about page."""
    return render_template(
        'about.html',
        title='About',
        year=datetime.now().year,
        message='Your application description page.'
    )
```


These two files establish the package **FlaskWeb** so we can import it, and provide routing for our requests to render templates using [Jinja2].

As you may have guessed from the preceding code, we're going to create three pages - all based off one shared template. These four files - **layout.html**, **index.html**, **about.html**, and **contact.html** - are placed into the *templates/* folder.

*layout.html*

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

                <a href="/" class="navbar-brand">Application name</a>
            </div>
            <div class="navbar-collapse collapse">
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav">

                    <li><a href="{{ url_for('about') }}">About</a></li>
                    <li><a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Contact</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container body-content">
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        <hr />
        <footer>
            <p>&copy; {{ year }} - My Flask Application</p>

     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    {% block scripts %}{% endblock %}

</body>
</html>
```

Inheriting from this layout template, we create three more templates that just define our basic website.

*index.html*
```XML
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block content %}

<div class="jumbotron">

Congratulations! You've now created all the necessary files for deploying Flask to Azure.

## Deployment
We are using Git to deploy to Azure. You need to use the Git Shell if you're on Windows to add the remote repository that the application is deployed. You should follow our [excellent guide](app-service-deploy-local-git.md) to get this all setup. Once your local Git repository is linked to the Azure Web App's, we can push our content. Once we push the repository, the Web App will deploy automatically. However, in our case this deployment will most likely fail. We want to take care of the environment's settings now. 

### Preparing the Remote Environment
Now that we have files in the remote environment, we can install our Python packages. The easiest way to do this is through Kudu, which is located at `http://<your-app>.scm.azurewebsites.net/`. You can then open up the console by selecting **Debug Console** --> **CMD**. From here, we can run PIP using the Python extension we installed.

1. Navigate to the folder of the Python installation where the extension was installed, which was `d:\home\python361x64` for our selected extension.
2. Use `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade -r d:\home\site\wwwroot\requirements.txt` to install all of the packages we need.

Now our Web App environment will have all the required Python packages for running Flask.

With everything setup, we can restart our application from the **Overview** blade. Once this completes, we should be able to navigate to our Web App's URL and find our completed Flask Application! The page is using [Bootstrap] to get styled, but you can add your own CSS or images in the *static* folder and link those in your templates.

## Next Steps

With your first web application deployed, you are probably thinking about ways to tinker with this project. In this tutorial, we didn't do any local deployment. Developing an application locally is a much quicker way to inspect your changes, and ensure you don't disrupt a functioning website.

The suggested method for this is [Virtual Environments]. With PIP and a Virtual Environment, we can create the requirements.txt and use it to keep the remote Azure Application running the same dependencies as the local one. You can then run Flask's [Development Server] to preview your web application locally before updating it in Azure.
